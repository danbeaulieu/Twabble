This is a simple Scrabble like game I built to learn Django. 

Idea was Twitter users would create games invite their friends (or play with strangers in public games) and the bot 
would assign points to players based on unique words in the twitter
messages using a Scrabble like scoring system.

No longer live, do what you want with it.
